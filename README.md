# Autonomous Agent Project

![Autonomous Agent](./resources/your-image.png)

## Overview

This project simulates autonomous buses navigating a 2D environment to collect fuel targets. Each bus moves towards fuel pickups to avoid running out of fuel, and when fuel is depleted, buses enter a wandering state until they refuel. The simulation is built using [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) for rendering and input handling.

## Features

- Multiple autonomous bus agents with fuel management.
- Intelligent targeting system for fuel pickups.
- Wandering behavior when buses run out of fuel.
- Speed boost power-up mechanic.
- Scoring system based on pickups collected.
- Dynamic stage progression with target resets and bus upgrades.

## Controls

- The simulation runs automatically once started.
- Observe bus behaviors as they collect fuel and avoid running out.

## Dependencies

- C++11 or later compiler.
- [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) â€” simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.
